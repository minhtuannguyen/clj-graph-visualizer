# clj-graph-visualizer

clj-graph-visualizer is just an experiment to evaluate how [netjsongraph](https://github.com/interop-dev/netjsongraph.js) deals with a very big graph.

## Installation
    $ ./lein.sh uberjar

## Usage
    $ java -jar clj-graph-visualizer1-0.1.0-standalone.jar

## Demo
Initialy the graph only has the root names "root".

    //to add 10 nodes to the graph
    $ ./test-resources/import_node.sh 10 https://clj-graph-visualizer.herokuapp.com/

    //to reset the graph, which then only has the root
    $curl -X DELETE https://clj-graph-visualizer.herokuapp.com/node/

The view can be seen under: [my demo app](https://clj-graph-visualizer.herokuapp.com/view/ "my demo app")

## Examples deployed locally
Initialy the graph only has the root names "root".

    //to add a node to the graph
    $ curl -X POST --data "parent=root&id=nodename" http://localhost:8080/node
    
    //to reset the graph, which then only has the root
    $curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/node/
